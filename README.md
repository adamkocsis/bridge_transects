# Some basic transects from the BRIDGE climate models

Check out the R file in `code`! This is a typical BRIDGE output. This output is from [this](https://www.paleo.bristol.ac.uk/ummodel/users/Valdes_et_al_2021/new2/) set.

We can use the last 800ka results from Antell et al. 2021 (PNAS), they are deposited [here](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4658884). Those results have 19 depth levels instead of 20, and they don't have numeric values, so I don't know exactly how deep they are - we might have to ask somebody.
